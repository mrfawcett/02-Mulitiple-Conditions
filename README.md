# Instructions

## Honor Roll
You are writing a program to help a school decide whether a student 
qualifies for the Honor Roll, Merit List, or No List based on their 
grades and behavior record. 

The method you will be completing will 
have the following parameters:
* GPA (a number between 0.0 and 4.0)
* Number of tardies (integer)
* Number of detentions (integer)

Apply the following rules:
* If GPA is 3.5 or higher and the student has no detentions, they may qualify for the Honor Roll.
But, if they also have fewer than 3 tardies, they are officially placed on the Honor Roll.
Otherwise, they are only eligible for the Merit List.
* If GPA is between 2.5 and 3.49 (inclusive) and they have fewer than 2 detentions, they qualify
for the Merit List. Otherwise, they are placed on No List.

## Theme Park
You have been hired by a theme park to write a program that checks 
 whether a visitor is eligible to go on certain rides. The eligibility 
 depends on the visitorâ€™s age, height, and special conditions like 
 having a VIP pass, a parent/guardian, or a younger sibling.
 
 Ride Rules
 
 Extreme Coaster:
* Must be at least 16 years old AND at least 60 inches tall.
* If the person has a VIP pass, they may ride if they are at least 
      14 years old AND at least 55 inches tall.
 
 Family River Ride:
* Must be at least 8 years old AND at least 40 inches tall.
* If younger than 8, they may still ride if they are with a parent/guardian.
 
 Kiddie Carousel:
* Available to everyone under 12 years old.
* If 12 or older, they can still ride only if they are with a younger 
      sibling.
