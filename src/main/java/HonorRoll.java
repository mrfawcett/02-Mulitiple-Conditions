/** READ FIRST
 * You are writing a program to help a school decide whether a student 
 * qualifies for the Honor Roll, Merit List, or No List based on their 
 * grades and behavior record. The method you will be completing will 
 * have the following parameters:
 *      GPA (a number between 0.0 and 4.0)
 *      Number of tardies (integer)
 *      Number of detentions (integer)
 * 
 * Apply the following rules:
 *      If GPA is 3.5 or higher and the student has no detentions, they 
 *      may qualify for the Honor Roll.
 *      But, if they also have fewer than 3 tardies, they are officially 
 *      placed on the Honor Roll.
 *      Otherwise, they are only eligible for the Merit List.
 * 
 *      If GPA is between 2.5 and 3.49 (inclusive) and they have fewer 
 *      than 2 detentions, they qualify for the Merit List.
 *      Otherwise, they are placed on No List.
 * 
 * Return the correct message:
 *      "Honor Roll"
 *      "Merit List"
 *      "No List"
