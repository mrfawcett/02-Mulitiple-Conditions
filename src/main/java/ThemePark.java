/** READ FIRST
 * You have been hired by a theme park to write a program that checks 
 * whether a visitor is eligible to go on certain rides. The eligibility 
 * depends on the visitorâ€™s age, height, and special conditions like 
 * having a VIP pass, a parent/guardian, or a younger sibling.
 * 
 * Ride Rules
 * 
 * Extreme Coaster:
 *      Must be at least 16 years old AND at least 60 inches tall.
 *      If the person has a VIP pass, they may ride if they are at least 
 *      14 years old AND at least 55 inches tall.
 * 
 * Family River Ride:
 *      Must be at least 8 years old AND at least 40 inches tall.
 *      If younger than 8, they may still ride if they are with a parent/guardian.
 * 
 * Kiddie Carousel:
 *      Available to everyone under 12 years old.
 *      If older than 12, they can still ride only if they are with a younger 
 *      sibling.
